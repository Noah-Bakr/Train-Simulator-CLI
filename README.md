# Train Simulator CLI
Terminal-Based Train Simulator for the Pakenham Line

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

## Overview
This terminal-based train simulator provides a simulated command-line experience of a train operating along Melbourne’s Pakenham line. Built in Java with Eclipse and thoroughly tested using JUnit, the simulator derives passenger count data from CSV files and offers train customisation and statistical reporting.

> [!NOTE]  
> The train line does not contain every station.

## Features

* **Line Simulation**: Simulates the Pakenham line from Flinders Street to Pakenham, including intermediate stations.
* **Train Configuration**: Create and delete train carriages, toggle direction and train line of choice.
* **Station Configuration**: Edit the passenger demend for each platform. for each time session of the day, add or remove station platforms.
* **Passenger Data**: Read and parse CSV files containing historical passenger counts per station, per hour.
* **Custom Schedules**: Define time session, each with their own data.
* **Real-time Statistics**: Display on-demand stats such as CO2 Emissions (overall and specific to train sections (locomotives/carriages)), passengers left behind, total passengers carried, and the number of complaints.
* **JUnit Test Suite**: Comprehensive automated tests covering core functionality, data parsing, and statistical calculations.

## Usage

1. **Loading Passenger Data**

   	Select `c) Import train stations map CSV`, and then `a) Import CSV from File` to import the train line.
   	Return to the Main Menu.
   	Select `d) Import a train station’s demand CSV`, and then `a) Import CSV from File` to import the demand of each station (number of passengers).

2. **Creating a Train**

   	Select `g) Simulate a train run` to view options for the simulation.
   	Select `a) Add/remove a carriage` to configure the size of the train.
   
3. **Configuring the Train Line and Direction**

   	Select `b) Specify line and direction`.

3. **Configuring the Time of Day**

   	Select `c) Specify time session`.
  
4. **Running the Simulation**

	Select `d) Run sim`.

   
5. **Viewing Statistics**

   Select `h) Show statistics based on last run`.

## Testing

All tests were created and executed using the Eclipse IDE’s built-in JUnit support (JUnit 5). To run the test suite:

1. Open the project in Eclipse.

2. Navigate to the src/trainSimulation/tests.java file.

3. Right-click on the test file.

4. Select `Run As`, `JUnit Test`.
